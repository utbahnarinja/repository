    <span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i></span>Having written a treatise on economics, Iqbal also wrote the Urdu ghazal Sare Jahan se Achccha Hindostan Hamara, which became a rallying cry against the British Raj. <br><br><span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i></span> The song, an ode to Hindustan (present-day Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan), eventually became a patriotic ballad sung largely in India. <br><br> <span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i></span>
    Iqbal is widely known as one of the most important figures in Urdu and Persian literature, having written numerous volumes of poetry in both languages. <br><br><span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i></span> After returning to Lahore in 1908, Iqbal taught philosophy and English literature while practicing law. <br><br><span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i><br><br><br><br><br></span> His first book, Asrár-I Khudí (The Secrets of the Self), was published in 1915, followed by Ramuz-e-Bekhudi (The Mysteries of Selflessness) in 1918—both of which are regarded as the base for his poetic philosophy. <br><br><span><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-right"></i></span> He continued to write and publish volumes of poetry up until his death on April 21, 1938. <br><br> </p>
